Installation guide

CaTSper.mlapp is a MATLAB App-Designer (version r2022a) file and runs on MATLAB environment. If MATLAB is not installed in your PC, please visit https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html and install the latest version before you run CaTSper.

However, if you modify mlapp files and commit back to the repository, please update the associated m file as well so that users can easily identify the changes in the code.
